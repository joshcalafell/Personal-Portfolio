## Some example work of mine

### Angular 17 Monorepo Example [https://github.com/joshcalafell/angular-monorepo](https://github.com/joshcalafell/angular-monorepo)

A monorepo is a single git repository that holds the source code for multiple applications and libraries, along with the tooling for them.

This project was built to be a sort of showcase as well as a learning experience of how Nx/Angular monorepos use of re-usa components via custom libraries and utilities, track and easily update multiple apps at once, keep track of dependencies for better CI/Workflow, and use of Nx tooling to get the job done quickly and easily.  

For this exercise, the main app is an app called "Inventory", and it's basically an inventory for a mock candle company with an "inventory", but also a cart, routing, layout, and use of several custom lib components and utilities. It is not a fully realized monorepo with many applications for brevity, but it does contain the spirit of the monorepo, if only for a few examples that adhere. I've tried my best to decide how much functionality I want to buil into an example. 

To start off, here's a quick video of a click through the app...
